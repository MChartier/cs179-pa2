Implement web page with suggested readings for Book Club.
On load, page shows all books already in the suggestions list.
Book suggestions stored in a database.

Implement functionality to add and remove books from the list.

For each book, collect:
  author
  title
  optional URL for image of cover (do not download, just hotlink)

For each book, allow people to add comments.
Comments should be hidden, with an option to unfold them.

Users should be able to mark/unmark books as "favorites".
Persist using local storage so that those marked persist through refresh.

All updates implemented in JavaScript, no page reloads.

Use jQuery Mobile as appropriate to implement UI componenets.

Extra credit: client-side search.
  Search box. When person types in a word, only entries containing that word
  are shown.

Solution should be robust.
  Input validation.
  Guard against injection attacks.
Product should be usable.
  Clear affordances.
  Very clear what user can and should do
